        <h1><a name="1" id="1"></a>Rekawa’s Sanctuary</h1>
        <p>Inspired by his love of the island and a vision to create a year round sanctuary for himself, Nick Buckingham passionately inspires others to enjoy some of the best that Sri Lanka has to offer. An empty rugged beach, a sleepy village atmosphere and Rekawa’s very own bird and wildlife sanctuary combine adventure with a taste of local culture. </p>
        <p>15 highly acclaimed suites & bedrooms benefit from south westerly views down the vast 6km long Rekawa Lagoon – home to abundant birdlife that can be watched from the privacy of your balcony or veranda and, by venturing onto the lagoon in a hotel canoe. With unusually generous proportions and 6 different floor layouts, all suites and bedrooms have been designed with sensitive flair. All harmonise well with the breathtaking natural environment and contribute significantly to the uniqueness of the hotel. </p>
        <p>Contrary to the ‘boutique’ hotel norm Buckingham Place is by no means elitist or ‘taking itself too seriously’. Instead, a mood of light heartedness and caring prevails, a mood likely to illicit that feeling of knowing you’ve arrived - at a genuinely friendly and homely place that when the time comes, you’ll be very sad to leave!<a name="5" id="5"></a></p>
        <div class="seperator"></div>
        <h1>Bedroom or Suite?</h1>
        <p>Rates and classification are not necessarily based on the size of your accommodation or whether it has a TV or not! Rate differentials generally reflect the extent of view over Rekawa Lagoon, a special feature such as an open-air bathroom, or a first floor or secluded location.<a name="3" id="3"></a></p>

            <p>These two spacious, elevated and detached - ground floor double-entrance bedrooms enjoy lagoon views both from the bedroom and the pergola-shaded balcony. The bright, spacious full bathrooms include bathtub and separate rain-shower above which are large skylights. Satellite TV is installed in both bedrooms but is removable upon request. </p>

            <p>Four, extra large, ground level detached bedrooms enjoy lagoon views both from the bedroom and a pergola-shaded veranda. Each has a bright and spacious full bathroom which includes an open-air rain-shower and bathtub with large skylight over head. A unique central skylight in the bedrooms produces a subtle shaft of natural light and a gentle wake up - tempting occupants to laze in bed and gaze at the spectacle! All four bedrooms are large enough to accommodate up to two extra single beds for accompanying guests (subject to prior arrangement). We have not installed TV in these bedrooms.</p>

        <div class="seperator"></div>        <h1>Swimming<br />
        </h1>
        <p>Rekawa Beach is breathtakingly beautiful and usually deserted. Sea bathing is not advised within the immediate vicinity of the hotel but a nearby rock pool (c15 minute walk) and much safer beaches are easily accessed by Tuk Tuk. </p>
        <p>For cooling off under the sun our modest hotel pool is adequate for most and, not overly challenging!</p>

        <div class="seperator"></div>        <h1>Children<br />
        </h1>
        <p>Buckingham Place wholeheartedly welcomes quiet children *7 years upwards (maximum of 2) by prior arrangement. (*Recent policy change)</p>
        <p>Specific child services, designated areas, waterslides and such like are not featured at the hotel, nonetheless the happiness and wellbeing of a guests’ child is just as important to us as that of its parents and other guests.  </p>
<p>We can offer; a suite into which a ‘bunk bed’ (sleeps 2) can be installed in a small, air-conditioned annex room or, a large bedroom into which up to 2 extra single beds can be installed. Each extra bed is charged at US$55 per night including breakfast.</p>
        <p><span class="orangeText"><strong>We respectfully ask all parents</strong></span><strong> to consider the tranquil nature of the hotel and the quiet enjoyment of others. </strong></p>
        <p>Buckingham Place is predominantly the choice of nature lovers, bird watchers, quiet couples and those in need of complete relaxation - and a peaceful dining experience!! Parents are therefore naturally asked to ensure their child does not use noise emitting devices in common areas of the hotel including the restaurant and does not disrupt the overall calm ambience of the hotel and its garden. Thank you. </p>
        <p><strong>Although we would like to welcome children of all ages and have previously done so we have found the hotel, restaurant and garden to be unsuitable for the very young. Parents are reminded that wildlife, our feral pony ‘Ginger’ and some areas of the hotel can be hazardous even to a 7 year old, particularly in view of its tropical jungle setting and remote access location. On arrival we will discuss your child’s eating preferences rather than offer typical ‘kids menus’ then tailor choices and charge sensibly and fairly.</strong></p>
